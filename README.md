Code for an application that allow to find copies of images.

The image comparison is hash based. Some algorithms are taken from https://github.com/bjlittle/imagehash.
The application has the ability to select different algorithms (phash, rhash, ahash, dhash), threshold, hash size, and each of these algorithms can be run through a cropping-resistant image encryption algorithm.


The code is provided as is and without any obligation. You can do whatever you want with this code.
